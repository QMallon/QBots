# Basic Python Bot Attempt 1
  Messing around to make Diablo 2 character go to Den of evil. D2 is running in window on 800x600 and at about 0,0 on monitor. Mostly testing out basic image stuff using PyAutoGUI. I used     Kian Brose's tutorial
  
  
 # Den of Evil Finder
   Mostly uses piautogui
 # Denv2
   Same goal but using opencv, Haar cascade classifiers 
   
  # MinecraftOpenCv
  Wanted to mmake a simpler idea work before doing more for my diablo ideas
   
 # OpenCvTutorials
   code from following tutorials from Learn Code by gaming some of it is modified
   
  # hsvFilterOpenCvTutorials
  basically just a few steps back on the tutorials used to gather screenshots for Haar and creating hsvFilters
